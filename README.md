# ResNet18_Finetuning
This repo contains a PyTorch implementation of the pretrained Resnet18 to classify images that may or not contains hornets in a bee farm.
The localization was based on a paper named "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization" by Bolei Zhou, Aditya Khosla, Agata Lapedriza, Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba
